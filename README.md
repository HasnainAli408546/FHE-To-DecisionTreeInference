This project is a small client–server demo of secure decision tree inference over encrypted data using CKKS FHE (TenSEAL) plus a light AES‑GCM wrapper for transport security. The client encrypts Iris feature vectors with a CKKS context that includes the secret key, sends only a public context + encrypted vector to the Flask server (wrapped with AES‑GCM for integrity and replay protection), and the server evaluates a pre-trained scikit‑learn decision tree as matrix–vector operations on ciphertexts. The server returns encrypted node scores, and the client decrypts them and runs the exact scikit‑learn-style tree traversal locally, so the server never sees any plaintext features or predictions
